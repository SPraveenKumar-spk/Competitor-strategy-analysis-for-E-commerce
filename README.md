# Setup Instructions

# 1. Clone the Repository


git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
This step involves cloning the project repository from a remote location (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) to your local machine.
Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of the repository.
After cloning, navigate to the project directory using the cd command.

# 2. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
This step installs the required Python libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.
The -r flag tells pip to install packages from the specified file.

# 3. Configure API Keys

This section outlines the steps to configure the necessary API keys for the project to function correctly.

# 5. Run the Streamlit Application

The command to run the Streamlit app is:

streamlit run app.py
This command will start the Streamlit app, which is likely the user interface for the project.

# Project Files

app.py: This is the main script for the application. It likely contains the core logic for data analysis, visualization, and interaction with the user interface.
scrape.py: This script is responsible for web scraping competitor data from various sources.
reviews.csv: This file contains sample customer reviews data that will be used for sentiment analysis.
competitor_data.csv: This file contains sample competitor data that will be used for analysis.
